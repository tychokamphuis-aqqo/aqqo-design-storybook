# Storybook-Specific Cursor Rules

This file contains Storybook-specific rules and guidelines for the Aqqo Design System project.

## ðŸ“š Storybook Development Rules

### Story File Requirements
- Every component MUST have a corresponding `.stories.tsx` file
- Stories must be placed in the same directory as the component
- Use the naming convention: `ComponentName.stories.tsx`
- Include comprehensive story coverage for all component states

### Story Structure Requirements
```typescript
// Required story structure
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/nextjs-vite';
import { fn } from 'storybook/test';
import { Component } from './Component';

const meta = {
  title: 'Components/ComponentName', // Follow this hierarchy
  component: Component,
  tags: ['autodocs'], // Always include for documentation
  parameters: {
    docs: {
      description: {
        component: 'Component description and usage guidelines',
      },
    },
  },
  argTypes: {
    // Define controls for all props
    variant: {
      control: { type: 'select' },
      options: ['primary', 'secondary'],
      description: 'Visual style variant',
    },
  },
  args: {
    // Default args
  },
} satisfies Meta<typeof Component>;

export default meta;
type Story = StoryObj<typeof meta>;
```

### Required Story Variations
Every component must include these story variations:

```typescript
// 1. Default story
export const Default: Story = {};

// 2. Variant stories
export const Primary: Story = { args: { variant: 'primary' } };
export const Secondary: Story = { args: { variant: 'secondary' } };

// 3. Size stories
export const Small: Story = { args: { size: 'small' } };
export const Large: Story = { args: { size: 'large' } };

// 4. State stories
export const Disabled: Story = { args: { disabled: true } };
export const Loading: Story = { args: { loading: true } };

// 5. Interactive stories
export const Interactive: Story = {
  play: async ({ canvasElement }) => {
    const canvas = within(canvasElement);
    const button = canvas.getByRole('button');
    await userEvent.click(button);
